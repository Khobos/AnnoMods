## Requirements

You need `Seat Of Power` DLC to use this mod.

You don't need `Seed Of Change` and `New World Rising`, but this mod also adds content for these DLCs.

## Content

It's a porting of the Old World ministry for the New World region. Policies are adapted accordingly for the needs of this region.

In addition, a specific palace has been added in the New World to make this region even more interesting.

## Known Issues

- The NW ministry interface always shows information relating to the OW. **Rely on the effects which will be indicated in the town halls, trades unions, harbour master's offices, residences and public buildings. It is not possible to modify it for technical reasons. **If you want to have the changes outside the game, refer to this [part](../docs/decrees.md).**
- The `Cultural Outreach Act` decree will be of no use in this region at the moment.
- The `Art Fairs Act` does not provide influence for obreros at the moment.
