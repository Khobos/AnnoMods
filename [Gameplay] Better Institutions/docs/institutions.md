# Better Institutions

## Description

A simple mod aimed at providing more emergency and public buildings at all existing population levels.

This is mainly to diversify your cities, while offering complementary functions.

I imagined buildings that could blend into small villages and towns as well as large metropolises.

There are also some ideas for your industrial estates.

### Beta Devnote: 
> Triggers are still in WIP and some buildings may be rebalanced.

> 3D models takes me a loooong time to make, so a few of these will use vanilla models atm. Some buildings may be redesigned/retextured.
  >> If you have any skills on Blender or Anno 3D Models and you want to contribute on this mod as a hobby, don't hesitate to contact me on the modding discord: https://discord.gg/YTQGDFK

> Effects can be rebalanced if necessary.
