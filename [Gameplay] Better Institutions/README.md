# Better Institutions (BETA VERSION)

## Requirements

The mod should work without any DLC.

## Content

A simple mod aimed at providing more emergencies buildings at all existing population levels.

This is mainly to diversify your cities, while offering complementary functions.

I imagined buildings that could blend into small villages and towns as well as large metropolises.

There are also some ideas for your industrial estates.

## Roadmap

The mod focuses mainly on emergency services, but it may also propose alternatives for public services in general (churches, schools, banks, etc.).

It will possibly include the New World, Enbesa and even the Arctic in a second phase.

**Your feedback will be greatly appreciated!** You can also send me suggestions on this topic from the Anno modding discord!

## Known Issues

- Some buildings are still WIP
- The park ranger GUI shows a false need for heat
- It is impossible to manually mobilise additionnal units in institutions with a production interface.
